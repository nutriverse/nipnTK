Description: An implementation of the National Information Platforms for 
    Nutrition or NiPN's analytic methods for assessing quality of anthropometric 
    datasets that include measurements of weight, height or length, middle upper 
    arm circumference, sex and age. The focus is on anthropometric status but 
    many of the presented methods could be applied to other variables.
