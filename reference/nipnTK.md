# NiPN data quality toolkit

An implementation of the National Information Platforms for Nutrition or
NiPN's analytic methods for assessing quality of anthropometric datasets
that include measurements of weight, height or length, middle upper arm
circumference, sex and age. The focus is on anthropometric status but
many of the presented methods could be applied to other variables. This
is a library of R functions for assessing data-quality in nutritional
anthropometry surveys.
