\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of ages. Should either be in whole months (integer) or in
calculated decimal months (numeric).}

}

A list of class "ageHeaping" with:\tabular{ll}{
   \strong{Variable} \tab \strong{Description} \cr
   \emph{X2} \tab Chi-squared test statistic \cr
   \emph{df} \tab Degrees of freedom or Chi-squared test \cr
   \emph{p} \tab \code{p-value} for Chi-squared test \cr
   \emph{tab} \tab Table of remainders (for \verb{x \\\%\\\%} divisor) \cr
   \emph{pct} \tab Table of proportions (\verb{\\\%}) of remainders for \verb{x \\\%\\\%} divisor) \cr

\description{
Age heaping is the tendency to report children's ages to the nearest year or
adultsâ€™ ages to the nearest multiple of five or ten years. Age heaping is
very common. This is a major reason why data from nutritional anthropometry
surveys is often analysed and reported using broad age groups.

\examples{
# Test for age heaping using SMART survey data in Kabul, Afghanistan (dp.ex02)
# using a divisor of 12
svy <- dp.ex02
ah12 <- ageHeaping(svy$age)
ah12

# Test for age heaping using SMART survey data in Kabul, Afthanistan (dp.ex02)
# using a divisor of 6
ah6 <- ageHeaping(svy$age, divisor = 6)
ah6
